## Overview

This repository accompanies our [ACL2025 Findings paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-acl.609/), providing models, noisy datasets, and tools for robust multilingual embeddings under OCR noise. You’ll find fine-tuned models, evaluation and training data, and utilities for simulating character-level OCR noise.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── noisy_evaluation_datasets
│   └── The noised evaluation datasets (CLSD - WMT19/21) produced.
├── noisy_finetuning_data
│   └── The 10K (per language) noised training samples (TED - X-News) used for fine-tuning the models. Includes both random and realistic OCR Noise variants.
├── ocr_simulator
│   └── The ocr_simulator library used to induce realistic ocr noise to texts.
├── generate_random_character_noise_latin_alphabet
│   └── The script to generate stochastically the character level noise used to fine-tune our models.
```

## Models

A version of our **OCR Robust models** (fine-tuned on [TED-X with random noise](noisy_finetuning_data/TED_data_random_noise_10k_sampled.csv)) is available on Hugging Face:  
[impresso-project/OCR-robust-gte-multilingual-base](https://huggingface.co/impresso-project/OCR-robust-gte-multilingual-base)

## Datasets

### Evaluation Datasets

Noisy variants of the CLSD WMT datasets are available in [noisy_evaluation_datasets](./noisy_evaluation_datasets).

### Finetuning Datasets

Noisy versions (random and realistic) of TED and X-News parallel texts are available in [noisy_finetuning_data](./noisy_finetuning_data).

### Other Datasets

Additional datasets used for evaluation and finetuning are also provided ([link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gydv66U99Gi5x7Uj_fJFLjZYEVC9EHsR/view?usp=sharing)):

## Further Support & Contributing
In the future, we will work towards creating multilingual embedding models that are diversely robust. If you are interested in contributing or need access to any (not yet) released material, please reach out to andrianos.michail@cl.uzh.ch.
